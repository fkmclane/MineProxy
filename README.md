MineProxy
=========

MineProxy is a small program that will proxy Minecraft clients or Minecraft servers to an [Mímameiðr](https://github.com/fkmclane/mimameid) authentication server.  The IP address for the authentication server is stored in a configuration file.  If the program is not given an argument, it will assume it is running a client and download the Minecraft launcher and the configuration file will be created in the `.minecraft` folder as `auth.properties`.  The server should be specified as `auth=<authserver>` in auth.properties.  If auth is blank or nonexistent, it will proxy it to the specified authentication server.  If the program is given one or more arguments, it will assume it is proxying a server, start the JAR passed as the first argument, and use the `auth=<authserver>` in `server.properties` in the current working directory.
